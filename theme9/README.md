## Screenshot previews
![Screenshot of a Tumblr blog styled similarly to a journal spread decorated with washi tape. Strips of 'tape' run along the top (labelled with the blog title and a subtitle) and the right (the blog and page navigation), all patterned with tiled images. The blog avatar is placed over the top-right tape intersection like a sticker, and another 'sticker' image is placed in the bottom left corner. In the center is a description block, bracketed by a header image and search bar on top, and a custom links section on the bottom, with a button to collapse the about section. The beginnings of a post are visible below.](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/theme8/theme8_screenshot1light.png?raw=true)
![The same blog, now in dark colors. The about section has been collapsed, showing the posts underneath. The posts are seemingly taped into place, with dates/note counts/usernames/tags etc. all written across more strips of tape. Special text, such as usernames, is in all caps, and the corners of posts and tape are strongly rounded. The posts are partially obscured by the 'sticker' image on the bottom left.](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/theme8/theme8screenshot2dark.png?raw=true)
![Another screenshot in light colors, showing a tag page. The about section is collapsed; underneath it is a header showing the number of posts displayed. One of the posts visible below has also been hidden due to being tagged with '#sensitive', with a button underneath to reveal it. As with the previous screenshot, this page is narrow, resulting in a stacked header layout with the blog navigation now underneath the title/subtitle, and the pagination offscreen at the bottom of the page.](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/theme8/theme8_screenshot3light.png?raw=true)
