## Screenshot previews
![Screenshot of a Tumblr blog styled similarly to a journal spread decorated with washi tape. Strips of 'tape' run along the left (labelled with the blog title) and the right (links to the posts, about, and navigation sections), all patterned with tiled images. The blog avatar and an additional image are placed near the tapes like stickers. In the center, the posts are seemingly taped into place, with dates/note counts/usernames/tags etc. all written across more strips of tape.](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/theme8/theme8_screenshot1light.png?raw=true)
![The same blog, now in dark colors. The tapes don't have image patterns and are solid blocks of color, though now with rounded corners. The blog has been scrolled to the bottom to show off different post types.](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/theme8/theme8screenshot2dark.png?raw=true)
![Another screenshot in light colors, showing a tag page. The tapes on the left and right have new image patterns that aren't tiled. The tapes on the posts, however, have no images, and are just flat color. One of the posts has also been hidden due to being tagged with '#spoilers', with a button underneath to reveal it.](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/theme8/theme8_screenshot3light.png?raw=true)
