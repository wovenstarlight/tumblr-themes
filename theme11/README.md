## Screenshot previews
![A Tumblr blog designed to almost perfectly resemble the AO3 work listing pages. The blog title and avatar replace the AO3 logo on the top left, and Ask/Submit etc. links are present on the search bar. Posts are present where the works should be, under a heading declaring the number of posts equal to the number of 'works' in the blog. Sidebars on the left and right contain the blog description, featured links and tags, an FAQ, progress bars, and more.](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/theme11/theme11_screenshot1light.png?raw=true)
![The same blog, open to a permalink page and swapped to Reversi colors. The left sidebar has been removed. The post itself shows each blogger's contribution in a blockquote, with post tags replacing work tags, and Via/Source links replacing the title and author. The rating icons on the top left are replaced by the permalink, day page, and post type icons.](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/theme11/theme11_screenshot2dark.png?raw=true)
