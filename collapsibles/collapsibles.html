<!--
	For a set of collapsible boxes. Useful for an information page!
	Demo page here: https://starlightthemes.tumblr.com/dropdowns
	The demo page lists my fanfiction, but you can list whatever you'd like ^_^

	Two part instructions below. Ctrl+F/Cmd+F to find them:
		1. HTML/JS: Installing on blog page
		2. CSS STYLING: Making it look right
-->


<!--
	1. HTML/JS: Installing on blog page

	A standard collapsible section ("div") has two parts:
	- the collapsible section's button ("clpbutton")
	- the collapsible content ("clpcontent")
	You can place anything you want inside the content section. I recommend
	placing standard text inside <p> tags to ensure a decent amount of spacing
	around it on either side.

	To create a series of collapsible sections in a page:
	- Go to https://www.tumblr.com/customize/YOUR_BLOG_NAME_HERE (replaced with
		your blog's name). From the bottom of the menu, edit an existing blog
		page or create a new blog page through "+ Add a page".
	- On a Standard Layout page, under the title bar, select the "<html>" option
		to switch to the HTML editor mode.
	- Copy the following default Collapsibles template into the page.
		Don't forget to include the <script> code! Ensure it's at the VERY BOTTOM
		of the entire page, even when you start adding more content to the page.

START COPYING FROM THE LINE BELOW -->

<div class="collapsible">
	<p class="clpbutton">Click to open the collapsible</p>
	<div class="clpcontent">
	<p>Collapsible content goes here. Add any HTML you want!</p>
	</div>
</div>

<script>
// Close all collapsible sections on initial pageload
$(".collapsible .clpcontent").hide();

// Make nested collapsibles have alternating backgrounds
$(".collapsible").each( function() {
	if ($(this).parent(".clpcontent").parent(".collapsible").hasClass("odd")) {
		$(this).addClass("even")
	}
	else { $(this).addClass("odd") }
});

// Click to collapse functionality
$(".collapsible > .clpbutton").click( function() {
	var collapsible = $(this).parent();
	var content = $(this).next();
	if (collapsible.hasClass("active")) { content.slideUp() }
	else { content.slideDown() }
	collapsible.toggleClass("active");
});
</script>

<!-- FINISH COPYING FROM THE LINE ABOVE

	Now you can get started editing! You can add as many collapsibles as you
	want, and nest as many collapsibles (place a collapsible section inside
	another collapsible section) as you like. Once you're done, make sure to
	Update Preview, ensure that everything looks as you want it to, and Save.

	****IMPORTANT NOTE:****
		Make sure you don't put a link inside the "clpbutton"! Since this is
		the text to open/close the dropdown, you don't want to add something
		clickable that DOESN'T open the dropdown. Since the text is already
		link-colored, you might confuse people, and they won't open/won't be
		able to open the collapsible section.
	
	When you're nesting collapsibles, make sure to place the entire collapsible
	section, <div class="collapsible"></div>, INSIDE the outer section's content,
	<div class="clpcontent"></div>. You can see a sample of this below- it's the
	code for the "S-Ranks" section from the demo page.

	2. CSS STYLING: Making it look right

	Here's the styling for the collapsible sections. From the main Customize menu,
	go to "Advanced options" at the very bottom. In the "Add Custom CSS" section,
	copy the following code into the box. If you already have any custom CSS,
	just add the following below it.
	(Make sure not to copy the <style> tags!)

START COPYING FROM THE LINE *BELOW* THIS ONE --><style>

.collapsible { margin-bottom: 1em }
.collapsible > .clpbutton {

    column-gap: 0.5em;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: color .2s;
	margin-bottom: 0.25em;
