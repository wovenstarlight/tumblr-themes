## Screenshot previews
![An image of a Tumblr blog featuring a white, navy blue, and red theme. A header bar with the avatar, title, and blog navigation stretches across the top. A banner image, taking up most of the top half of the page, is overlaid with the blog description, custom links, and a search bar. Visible just below the banner is a page navigation menu, followed by the top of a post with a pin icon.](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/theme6/theme6_screenshot1light.png?raw=true)
![The same blog, now in black, red, and lavender colors. It is scrolled down to show more posts. The post bodies have each reblog's content in a Twitter thread-like structure, with a bar running down the side of the post through each user's icon. Tags, placed at the bottom of each post, are hidden behind a "show tags" button. Special text across the page (such as the blog title, post data and tags, and usernames) has been entirely converted to lowercase.](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/theme6/theme6_screenshot2dark.png?raw=true)
![The blog in white/blue/red colors, showing a tag page. The page header offers a chronological or reverse-chronological view of the tagged posts. In the post itself, tags are visible, without a show tags button. Special text across the page has been entirely converted to uppercase or small caps.](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/theme6/theme6_screenshot3light.png?raw=true)
