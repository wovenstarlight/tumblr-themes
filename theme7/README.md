## Screenshot previews
![An image of a Tumblr blog featuring a white and purple color theme; it strongly resembles the Tumblr in-dashboard blog view. On the left is a section with the header image, avatar, title, and description. Throughout this section are included a highlighted link, as well as the ask/submit links, messaging button, palette swap button, and search bar. The sidebar includes a group of three featured posts, a list of updates with dates attached, and a list of blog members.](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/theme7/theme7_screenshot1light.png?raw=true)
![The same blog, now in black and purple colors, scrolled further down to show the posts. Via and source links are present in the post headers, along with the date and time of the posts. All the content of the post visually resembles the dashboard display of posts, including the styling of audio and text posts.](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/theme7/theme7_screenshot2dark.png?raw=true)
![The same blog, back in white and purple colors, scrolled to the bottom of the page. The posts now have their tags hidden by default, as well as a new tag icon next to the like and reblog buttons at the bottom of the post. In the bottom-most post, the tag icon is highlighted, and the post tags are visible. Page navigation below the posts shows that this is page 1 of 3, and has an arrow icon linking to the next page. In the sidebar, a Navigation section is visible below the members section, offering unlimited custom links.](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/theme7/theme7_screenshot3light.png?raw=true)
