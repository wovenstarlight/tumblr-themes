# Tumblr themes by wovenstarlight

This repository contains the codes for all my Tumblr themes.

My theme blog is [starlightthemes](https://starlightthemes.tumblr.com). For questions, concerns, or requests, send me an [ask](https://starlightthemes.tumblr.com/ask). If asking for help with a bug, make sure you include a link to a page where I can see the bug. You can also add images, if you'd like, by [submitting](https://starlightthemes.tumblr.com/submit) your request instead.

Blog previews can be seen at [starlightpreviews](https://starlightpreviews.tumblr.com). The main blog uses my most recent theme, and static previews are available for all themes (see below for links).

My main blog is [wovenstarlight](https://wovenstarlight.tumblr.com).

## Collapsible sections
I've made a guide to adding collapsible sections to your blogs if they're using my themes. As a tie-in to my themes, they have associated styling to make them look good based on whatever colors you've chosen for your blog.

For a guide on installing them, [see here.](https://wovenstarlight.github.io/tumblr-themes/collapsibles/)
