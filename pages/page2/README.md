## Screenshot previews
![An image of a Tumblr page featuring a theme in pale purple colors with a field of lavender flowers as the background. At the top of the page sit the blog icon, styled to look like a planet, and beside it is the page title ('callisto'). To their right, circular links with icons act as the blog navigation, color mode toggle, and page credit. The link sections lie below this header section, their text inside boxes that have crosshairs on the top left and bottom right. The links are lined up horizontally, with category names highlighted at the top. Some category names and links have icons alongside them.](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/pages/page2/page2_light.png?raw=true)
