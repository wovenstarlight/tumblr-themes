## Screenshot previews
![An image of a Tumblr page featuring a dark red and gold theme. In the sidebar, the blog icon is styled to look like a planet. Under it, circular links with icons act as the blog navigation; each button has its own unique icon. The description and title ('europa') are inside a box with crosshairs framing opposite corners. The link sections, on the left side of the page, are similarly encased inside crosshairs. A vertical line drawn between the posts and sidebar splits the screen in two, with a lightning-bolt icon at the bottom. In the link sections to the left, links are lined up horizontally, with category names highlighted at the top. Some category names and links have icons alongside them.](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/pages/page1/page1_dark.png?raw=true)
