## Screenshot previews
![An image of a Tumblr blog featuring a dark red and gold theme. In the sidebar, the blog icon is styled to look like a planet. Under it, circular links with icons act as the blog navigation; each button has its own unique icon. The description and title are inside a box with crosshairs framing opposite corners. The posts, on the left side of the page, are similarly encased inside crosshairs. All-uppercase text on the top and bottom of each post lists the post dates, note counts, and tags. A vertical line drawn between the posts and sidebar splits the screen in two; aligned to its center is the page navigation menu, complete with a lightning-bolt icon at the bottom. The current page is highlighted in this navigation menu. The title of the blog is "as you wish." and the description reads "When is a monster not a monster? Oh, when you love it."](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/theme5/theme5_screenshot1dark.png?raw=true)
![The same blog as before, now in a light color scheme of cream and pink, and using sans-serif fonts instead of serif ones. The planet-like icon, being hovered over, is shifted to the side, revealing three links- one a color mode toggle with a moon icon, one theme download button, and one blog info button. Post tags have been replaced with a 'show tags' button. Post dates, note counts, and the show tags button are also in all lowercase. The navigation icons are different, with pawprints, animals, and flame/snowflake themes instead of the previous lightning bolt, wool, dragons, and bow/arrows. The title and description in the sidebar have also been updated. The title reads 'damned skill' and the description reads "I can't say I have faith in myself yet, but the name 'partner' is one I like".](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/theme5/theme5_screenshot2light.png?raw=true)
![The same blog as previous, in its light cream and pink color scheme, but with the original serif fonts, icons, and "as you wish" title and description. It shows a tag page, with a page header listing 3 available results for the "ask" tag, with links to see the posts in newest-first or oldest-first orders. Only one post is visible, with dates and tags completely hidden from view. In the sidebar, the color mode toggle has been replaced by the blog's lightning-bolt icon, and the navigation buttons all have identical chain-link icons.](https://github.com/wovenstarlight/tumblr-themes/blob/main/theme5/theme5_screenshot3light.png?raw=true)
